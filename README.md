# temperature_prediction
A simple Python Program to Predict Temperature with respect to time and humidity
 It first collects the weather data for the previous day and time and stores it in three lists: temperatures, humidity, and times. It then converts these lists to numpy arrays and uses them to train a linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class. Finally, it uses the trained model to make a prediction for the current day and time (assuming the temperature is 277.15 degrees and the time is 6am).
